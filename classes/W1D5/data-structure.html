		<h3>What is a Data Structure?</h3>
		<p>
			Data structures are ways to organize and store data in a computer so that
			it can be accessed and modified efficiently.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Combining Arrays and Objects</h3>
		<p>
			Arrays and objects can be nested within each other to store complex and
			structured data.
		</p>

		<h3>Example: Organizing Students by Age</h3>
		<pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
const students = [
{ name: "Bob", age: 40 },
{ name: "Alice", age: 40 },
{ name: "John", age: 28 },
{ name: "Toto", age: 26 }
];

const organizedStudents = {};
for (const student of students) {
if (!organizedStudents[student.age]) {
  organizedStudents[student.age] = [student.name];
} else {
  organizedStudents[student.age].push(student.name);
}
}
      </code></pre>
		<p>
			Here, students are grouped by age, demonstrating how to dynamically create
			and access keys and values in an object.
		</p>

		<h3>Accessing Nested Data</h3>
		<p>
			Values can be accessed in nested arrays and objects using a combination of
			dot notation and bracket notation.
		</p>
		<pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
console.log(organizedStudents[40]); // Accessing array of names by age
      </code></pre>

		<h3>Complex Example: Organizing a Fridge</h3>
		<pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
const fridge = [
{ name: "Tomatoes", category: "vegetable" },
{ name: "Carrots", category: "vegetable" },
{ name: "Duck", category: "meat" }
];

const organizedFridge = {};
for (const food of fridge) {
if (!organizedFridge[food.category]) {
  organizedFridge[food.category] = [food.name];
} else {
  organizedFridge[food.category].push(food.name);
}
}
      </code></pre>
		<p>
			This demonstrates organizing items in a fridge by category, illustrating a
			practical application of combining arrays and objects.
