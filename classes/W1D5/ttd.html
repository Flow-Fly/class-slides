		<h3>What is Software Testing?</h3>
		<p>
			Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a
			software product or application does what it is supposed to do.

		<h3>Why is Software Testing Important?</h3>
		<p>
			Testing ensures the reliability, security, and high performance of
			software, helping to catch bugs and errors before they reach the end-user.

		<h3>The Test-Driven Development Methodology</h3>
		<p>
			TDD is a software development approach where tests are written before the
			code itself, guiding the software development process.

		<h3>The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Red:</strong> Write a test that fails because the feature isn't
				implemented yet.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Green:</strong> Write the minimal amount of code necessary to
				make the test pass.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Refactor:</strong> Clean up the code, maintaining its
				functionality but improving its structure, readability, and possibly
				performance.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Types of Tests</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Unit Tests:</strong> Test individual units or components of the
				software.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Integration Tests:</strong> Test the integration or interaction
				between different pieces of the software.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>End-to-End Tests:</strong> Test the entire application, from
				start to finish, to ensure the flow works as expected.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Each type of test serves a different purpose and is used at different
			stages of development.
