					<h2>Introduction to Test-Driven Development (TDD)</h2>
					<p>
						Understanding the fundamentals of software testing and the TDD
						approach.

					<h3>What is Software Testing?</h3>
					<p>
						Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a
						software product or application does what it is supposed to do.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Why is Software Testing Important?</h3>
					<p>
						Testing ensures the reliability, security, and high performance of
						software, helping to catch bugs and errors before they reach the
						end-user.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>The Test-Driven Development Methodology</h3>
					<p>
						TDD is a software development approach where tests are written
						before the code itself, guiding the software development process.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Red:</strong> Write a test that fails because the feature
							isn't implemented yet.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Green:</strong> Write the minimal amount of code necessary
							to make the test pass.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Refactor:</strong> Clean up the code, maintaining its
							functionality but improving its structure, readability, and
							possibly performance.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Types of Tests</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Unit Tests:</strong> Test individual units or components
							of the software.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Integration Tests:</strong> Test the integration or
							interaction between different pieces of the software.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>End-to-End Tests:</strong> Test the entire application,
							from start to finish, to ensure the flow works as expected.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Each type of test serves a different purpose and is used at
						different stages of development.
