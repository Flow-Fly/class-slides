					<h2>Introduction to JavaScript</h2>
					<p>
						Discover the fascinating journey of JavaScript, from its rapid
						development to becoming a cornerstone of the modern web.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>The Origin Story</h3>
					<p>
						Brendan Eich developed JavaScript in just 10 days for Netscape
						Navigator 2.0, marking the start of an era in 1995.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>JavaScript: The Third Language of the Web</h3>
					<p>
						After HTML and CSS, JavaScript emerged as the scripting language
						that added interactivity to the static web.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>JScript and Browser Wars</h3>
					<p>
						Microsoft's introduction of JScript sparked the browser wars,
						leading to compatibility issues that plagued developers.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Standardization by ECMA</h3>
					<p>
						The European Computer Manufacturers Association (now Ecma
						International) stepped in to standardize the language as ECMAScript,
						bringing order to the chaos.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Evolution of ECMAScript</h3>
					<p>
						From the first version in 1997 to the modern "living standard"
						approach with yearly updates, ECMAScript has continuously evolved to
						meet the web's growing needs.
					</p>
				</section>

						<h3>Why History?</h3>
						<p>
							Understanding JavaScript's history helps us appreciate the reasons
							behind its design decisions and quirks.
						</p>
						<p>
							Luckily, you don't need to know the history of JavaScript to be
							able to use it, or to get a job in it. Where it helps to know the
							history is in understanding <em>why</em> certain things are the
							way they are.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Why History?</h3>
						<p>
							The example of <code>ES4</code> tells answers the question you may
							have: <em> why don't they just fix it? </em>
						</p>
						<p>
							Making a <em> breaking change </em> to a language specification
							means that <bold>all existing code may stop working</bold>.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is a bad idea: we want our browsers to be backwards
							compatible, and so the ECMAScript specifications should be.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Learning JavaScript Today</h3>
					<p>
						Despite its complex history, mastering JavaScript opens doors to
						modern web development, without needing to dwell on past browser
						wars or version conflicts.
					</p>
				</section>
